Q1) Sorting Elements of an Array by Frequency
Given an array A[] of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. That is ele-ments that have higher frequency come first. If frequencies of two elements are same, then smaller number comes first. 

Input: The first line of input should contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The description of T test cases follows. 
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array. 

Output: For each test case, in a new line, print each sorted array in a separate line. For each array its numbers should be separated by space. 
Example: 
Input: 
2 
5 
5 5 4 6 4 5 
9 9 9 2 5 
Output: 
4 4 5 5 6 
9 9 9 2 5
